## Downloading and installing the calculator

First of all, you must have dotnet SDK version 6.0. you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

Run `bun setup`. It needs two arguments: `owner`, `branch`. Here's an example for `Xexxar`'s `aimRewriteTap` branch:
    
```bun run setup Xexxar aimRewriteTap```

if no arguments are provided, it defaults to Xexxar/aimRewriteTap.

If anything goes wrong, you can do it manually by following [this tutorial](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1116047971583262850/1191379178147295292/How_to_set_up_rework_calculator_and_also_simulate_scores2.txt) or simply giving me a shout at @yorunoken on Discord.
